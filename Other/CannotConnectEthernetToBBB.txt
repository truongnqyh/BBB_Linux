        gateway 192.168.7.1 --> host's ip

--> One issue that i face with my PC(HP Zbook G3 or other HP PC maybe)
I cannot both turn on Wifi and get the ethernet via router at the same time then i cannot share internet from wifi to ethernet. 
The reason is from the BIOS in my PC, the option LAN/WLAN auto switching is turned on by default. Then i only can use one option
at a particular time.
    To fix this, enter BIOS with F10 while when PC's doing some initial configuration. Setting is located in Advanced tab, 
then choose Build-In Device Options link. Disable LAN/WLAN auto switching and restart. Then it works for me.
