        gateway 192.168.7.1 --> host's ip

--> One issue that i face with my PC(HP Zbook G3 or other HP PC maybe)
I cannot both turn on Wifi and get the ethernet via router at the same time then i cannot share internet from wifi to ethernet. 
The problem is "BIOS" in my PC. The option "LAN/WLAN auto switching" is turned on by default. Then i can only use Wifi or ethernet
at a particular time.
    To fix this, enter "BIOS" with "F10" while when PC's doing some initial configuration. Setting is located in "Advanced" tab, 
then choose "Build-In Device Options". Disable LAN/WLAN auto switching and restart. It works for me :D
